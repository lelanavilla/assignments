                            <p>Requirements for this site:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Site must provide the owner with a way to add work to his portfolio himself.</li>
                                <li>Work added must automatically be included to the portfolio page.</li>
                                <li>A booking application for site must be created that notifies the owner when a potential client schedules a booking.</li>
                                <li>Site must visually represent the companies image, with bright contrasts, and a landing page that grabs your attention, but isnt crowded. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>

                                For this project I built a server, and created a private API with mongoDB, mongoose, and express, so I could call this API to populate the portfolio page with the photographers images, and provide the ability to add more images. The owner didnt want to
                                have to sign into the site to add images, and didnt want anything on the site that suggested that this option even existed. The site also required the creation of a booking application so potential clients could when schedule
                                appointments, and the notification be automatically sent to the owner by email.

                            </p>
                            <p>Some of the difficulties I had while creating this site was finding a unique way to present the images in the owners portfolio, that wasnt just on a normal 2d plane. I decided to use the turn.js library to create the 3d magazine
                                with the owners images on the pages. Getting the state changes that occur with each "turn of the page" in turn.js was tricky but I think using React, Redux, and React Router was the best decision, as I had much more control
                                of the state. page for him.
                            </p>
