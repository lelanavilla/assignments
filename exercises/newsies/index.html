   <div class=" article-section"><p class=" article-text"> Today the tech industry is composed mainly of men, but it wasn't always this way, in fact, with out the following women computer programming and development wouldnt exist today.
        <br><strong>Hedy Lamarr</strong> is remembered as a stunning legend in Hollywood's Golden Age. However, most people do not know that she would co-patent the technology for today's cellphones, Wi-Fi and GPS by building a torpedo for the U.S.Navy. Proof that it is possible to be beautiful and smart.
        <br> <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> Women in the 1800's rarely received credit for their ideas and inventions, rountinely having to " co-author" papers with a man to have the paper taken seriously. Her papers described how codes could be created to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the paper. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.
        <br>
        <strong>Grace Hopper</strong>United States Navy Admiral Grace Hopper (1906â€“1992) was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. Her belief that programming languages should be as easily understood as English was highly influential on the development of one of the first programming languages called COBOL.
