Her papers described how codes could be created to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the paper. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.
